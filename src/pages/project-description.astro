        Shale is a 2D search-action platformer built in the Godot Engine, where
        you play as a girl with mysterious cloning powers named Shale. Shale
        lives in the Chasm, a cavern where monsters have started showing up as
        the air gets colder and colder, disrupting life in the fragile society
        that has developed since humanity reached the stars and all but forgot
        about their species' cradle.
      </p>
      <p>
        Explore, gather equipment, solve puzzles, and find out who is causing
        this mysterious phenomenon and why.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even if Shale can't handle something alone, she's never alone when she's with
        her clone. The clone mirrors her movements, and even the act of
        splitting into two can provide some benefits. Place a clone on a switch
        to keep it open, split mid-jump for extra jump height, double your
        firepower against enemies, and explore multiple areas simultaneously.
      </p>
      <p>
        Use tools you find in the labyrinth to help with solving puzzles. The
        Heart of Siracus can freeze enemies in place, letting you create your
        own platforms. The Missile Launcher launches characters that its
        missiles hit, including yourself or your clone.
      </p>
      <p>
        Find logbooks and read the history of the Chasm, the Aether lingering in its
        air, and the doomed world surrounding it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even in a bleak world, the mistakes of the past need not be the future.
